Single thread. Generally no other disk activity (2TB HDD)
Purely testing how large the buffer is when reading files, measured in bytes.

Hypothesis: On extremely large files, a larger buffer size should increase performance by removing wasted time on MD5 updates and stuff.
A 4096 could be more efficient for a use cases with a large quantity very small files as it is close to a HDD block size.

This test is done on T:\temp transfers\
	Totally 104GB
	This contains RockYou, RockYou2021, and RockYou2021 (Compressed)


Exact File: 1018 (16:58)
 
Jadin Testing:
	4096: 1001 seconds (16:41)
	65536: 1001 seconds (16:41)

Results: More testing is needed, but it seems like with big files the small buffer size is not a bottleneck.
	Another test will be done on my SSD where the bottleneck could shift to memory/CPU.
