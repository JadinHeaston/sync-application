# Description
Sync Application is a project created out of frustration with other free file backup tools. I found that other free tools wouldn't consistently copy files, or folders, and weren't byte-for-byte copies of the data I provided. I was also dissatisfied by the performance of these tools, with backups sometimes taking 12+ hours when dealing with only ~500GB of data.
Additionally, I found that some features that I desired simply did not exist.
    I will eventually be adding those features to this application.


This is a passion tool, and it's only a plus if others can find some use from it.

# Requirements
This application is compiled to include as many dependencies as possible.
As of right now, I am aware of issues running on machines that do not have the [vc_redist_x64 redistributable package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).

# Installation
You can download the pre-configured release binaries from this GitHub page. As of right now, they are only verified to work on Windows 10 with limited testing.
You can also compile your own binaries by downloading the source files, opening the .sln file, and building it.
(Eventually, I will provide a better in-depth walk-through.)

# Options
"Sync Application.exe" [OPTIONS] -o <OPERATION_MODE> -s <DIRECTORY_PATH> -d <DIRECTORY_PATH>

# Contact
Please reach out if you run into any bugs or issues.
I can not promise that I will implement anything, or respond, but I am more likely to if I am aware of the problem to begin with.
